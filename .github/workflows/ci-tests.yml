#### LOCAL DEV COMMAND
# To run this locally use the act command
# Install from: https://github.com/nektos/act
#
# You will also need to temporarily update the volume mount paths in the
# docker compose file to be absolute paths on your machine. This should be temporary,
# but is necessary because of a bug with ACT: https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/410
#
# Run: act --platform ubuntu-latest=ubuntu-latest=nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04
# This will use a runner that has all the commands we need. This should only be used to
# modifying these actions, as the image is very large. If you are trying to run the
# tests locally, simply run them in docker.
#
# Use the following for the node matrix locally, or any other value,
# but you don't need all of them:
# node-version: [10.x]
